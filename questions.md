# Development questions/thoughts

1. What is the font name?
2. The offwidth logo is a black dot - can I have that asset?
3. Create account page: People don't ask for a password twice anymore as most people don't remember their password or have a password manager and it can be annoying to add a password twice on a phone
4. Some fields need to be thought out a little bit. For instance, the create account form has fields like "Address/Country" -> Do we need a person's address? If we do we need to give them more space to fill it out. Do we need their gender? Probably not. Do we need their phone number? Maybe not.
5. What is the flow of these pages? I am starting with the sign up/ sign in process. Once we're in - what does a person see? How do the pages connect? It'd be good to have a flow chart of sorts which explains how all of this is linked up.
6. I don't see a sign in page - happy to think one up but don't know if I'm missing some files.
